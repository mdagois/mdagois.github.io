            line compare
            Naive implementation
            Optimized implementation
            Using sprites for overlap
            Using one single halt or several halts
            Benefit: supported in hardware (light weight)
            Drawback: layers cannot overlap unless using sprites, but hit sprite limits + only 2 colors (bg sees through)
          Using tiles
            Explanation
            Benefit: layers can overlap, can work vertically, works for top down views (zelda-like or shmups)
            Drawback: uses more rom space, more work in the vblank, must respect tile boundaries
            CGB: can use DMA
          Conclusion
            Mix both techniques
            Faster data transfers on the DMG using pop slide
            No need for interrupt in an intro screen
            Read the book

      <h4>Parallax Scrolling on the Game Boy</h4>
        <p>
          This article is an in-depth guide about implementing parallax scrolling on the Game Boy.
          xxx
          We'll learn about two techniques that you can use to add parallax scrolling to your Game Boy games.
          Both techniques have benefits and drawbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parallax scrolling is a graphics technique used to create the illusion of depth with 2D graphics.
          Graphics elements that are meant to be further away from the observer move more slowly than elements that are supposed to be nearer.
          The effect is illustrated in Figure 1.

          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          works on Game Boy color.
          Both implementations have benefits and drawbacks.
          techniques you can use to add parallax scrolling to your Game Boy games.
          We'll use assembly for the code snippet, but the theory presented here should also be relevant to games programmed in C.
          The technical details might even work on other consoles, such as the NES or the Master System.
